## **Architecture & Design**

This app is built using Next.js with API routes for backend logic. It uses NextAuth for authentication and React hooks for state management.

### **Why Next.js?**
- Server-side rendering (good for SEO)
- API routes included (no need for a separate backend)
- Fast image optimization (`next/image`)

### **Authentication**
- Users log in using NextAuth.js
- JWT-based authentication (no session storage needed)

### **State Management**
- Uses `useReducer` for managing form state
- `useMemo` for sorting and filtering leads efficiently

### **Sorting & Pagination**
- Lead data is sorted client-side using `useMemo()`
- Pagination is handled using `slice()`

## **API Routes**

| Route          | Method | Description              |
|---------------|--------|---------------------------|
| `/api/leads`  | GET    | Fetch all submitted leads |
| `/api/leads`  | POST   | Submit a new lead         |

fetch("/api/leads")
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
